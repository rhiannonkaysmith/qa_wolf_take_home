As someone who has worked in QA I have always tried to find better ways automation can be done or improved upon. Starting out my career 
I had no programming knowledge, being keen to automate tasks I learnt python and sql while on the job. Understanding how HTML works and 
using xpaths daily within my job doing web scraping, which was beyond my job title. Taking ownership of the scraping allowed me to get stuck
into each problem and work to solve it while collaborating with others. Reviewing PRs from the team and mentoring others on areas where
my skillset was greater and learning from team members with different skills. This allowed me the freedom to experiment with new ideas
constantly to improve systems while learning something new. This is why I believe QA Wolf would be a great fit as a start-up company for
myself as I want to be a part of shaping the company as well as myself. I am always looking to try something new and I hope my 
assessment shows you this.
Being keen on continuing my development I have been progressing in my coding skills by challenging myself on sites such as AdventOfCode as
well as codinggames. With little knowledge of JavaScript and never using Playwright before I saw this assessment as a challenge,
reading documentation I have completed the task. I am looking forward to receiving your feedback on my approach as well as improvements.
